# SokoBlit

![Build](https://github.com/ahnlak-blit32/sokoblit/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

SokoBlit is an implementation of Sokoban for the 32Blit handheld console.

It was largely developed as a way of exploring the `TileMap` handling of the
32Blit API, but hopefully should be a fun little puzzle game too!

As ever, this is released under the MIT License.

Share and Enjoy!
